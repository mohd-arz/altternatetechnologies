                                  <p>Almost twenty years ago, urban residents began to recognize the benefits of
                                      source-level waste management and recovery of energy harnessing the power of
                                      nature to help reduce their waste issues and save their fuel or electricity
                                      consumption. Products like incinerators and Bio methanation plants grew in
                                      demand and, a small business was born to service the need.</p> <br>
                                     <p> However, most of the equipment available in the market was often unscientific, poor
                                      in technology, and creating a negative impact on the environment. It neither met the
                                      needs of the world nor decreased their carbon footprint. Many are expensive,
                                      consuming vast areas and are unviable due to operational costs.</p><br>
                                       This very quandary set a small team of passionate members on a quest to
                                      find suitable innovations, test them for various types of waste treatment and use the
                                      results to bring a range of environmentally sound, cost-effective products suitable
                                      for each sector, either home, once, residential colonies, educational institutions,
                                      marriage hall, industries, hospitals, hotels, railway station, airport or even MSW.
