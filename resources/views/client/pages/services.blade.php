                  Altternate Technologies, an ISO 9001:2015, 14001: 2015 & 45001: 2018 certified MSME, was formed in 2012 by a number of key professionals in the waste management industry. 
                  The Company is listed in the Government e Market place [GeM] portal with Seller ID: WKSF21000 464 2040.

                  We manufacture and implement Advanced Waste Management machines designed
based on innovative and established thermo-chemical and biochemical technologies
indigenously developed through years of research and development. We offer a complete
residue free waste management and waste to energy solution for variety of industries
throughout India.

                  The basic technology of fuel free incineration was originally introduced in the year
2009 and in 2011 Started
commercial marketing of the
equipment in various capacities to
serve different type of customers
from households, Public and private
Sector establishments, Airports,
Railways up to Local self-govt.
bodies.
We have upgraded our
Technology into Waste to
Energy[WtE] to accompany “2013
Energy from Waste Guide” of the
“Depa rtment for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs, UK” that
have a role in diverting Waste into
useful energy and cut short
Conventional Hydro-carbo fuels.
Though WtE technologies were
attractive and a trash to Treasure
concept, we identified that
invariable discharges from the plant
[bottom ash, Biodigester slurry etc]
was still a problem. Available
technologies for processing the
discharge were either expensive or
complex to practice.

guidance of Dr. VB Manilal, former

MISSION by implementing Waste to
Energy MSW management, reducing
landfills and thereby reducing risks and
hazards associated with it.
We have the technical know-how to
convert Biodigester discharge into finegrain dry manure storable for a considerable period
without losing freshness or nutrient values. The
brown-black colored dry manure derived by the
process has fibre rich texture and is enriched with
all micronutrients and other elements present in the
waste. Laboratory tests certify that it is vital
manure with a Ph level between 6.9 - 7.8. {with
20% moisture} and stable in Nitrogen, Potassium
and phosphorus content.
The bottom ash is processed and is used to
produce Pavement blocks and light weight ash
bricks which has wide commercial utility.
There are many waste management options
available today out of which is unique. According
to us the first and most desirable option is not to
produce waste and the least preferred option is land
filling. With WtE technology and Associated
discharge management technologies, we are a standalone Service provider.

                  The Organic fraction of the solid waste can be
treated in our advanced high lift anaerobic
bioreactors and converted into useful Bioenergy
and biomanure. The biogas is treated to
eliminate CO2, H2S and H2O and compressed to
equalize with LPG for heating purposes.
Methane can also be used to generate Electricity
for lighting purposes using appropriate IC
Engine. Higher capacity plants [≥ 1.0 TPD] use electricity generated within the system to
run the plant.

                  Advanced anaerobic dual tubular
bioreactor uses continuous stirring
method for mixing the feed with
microbial culture. The system removes
90% of the Volatile Solids to produce
Methane rich biogas at the rate 800
liter/kg VS loading with 65 - 70% CH4 content. Discharge will be stored as dry granular
Bio manure and supplied to farmers.

                  Non-recyclable mixed fraction of dry solid
waste, derived after sorting out recycling
materials, demolition debris, biomedical and ewaste will be treated in the Scientific Waste to
Energy incinerators and converted into Heat, flue gas and sterile ash. High heat energy
recovered can be used to generate Steam or steam water. The sterile bottom ash will be
used to produce Ash blocks and pavement bricks.

                  Various capacities are available starting from
      25kg/h up to 50.0 ton per day. All plants are
      tailor made to suit the geographical and climatic
      conditions of each location as well as the nature
      and volume of the waste.
